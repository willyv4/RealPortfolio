        Hey, Iâ€™m William Valadez! I have a strong passion for creating user
        interfaces and an effortless user experience as well as creating
        functional programs! My web development journey started when I realized
        that managing in the manufacturing industry wasn't as fun or challenging
        as my new found obsession, coding. So from that point i got a new less time consuming job and i've been
        recourcelful in teaching my self how to code. I'm very busy as i work
        full time and i'm a full time bussiness student, yet over the past 7 months
        i've managed to become a compenant developer. My short-term goal is to get a web
        development internship or junior dev position. I look forward to learning and working with professionals i'm excited to put in the time and effort.
